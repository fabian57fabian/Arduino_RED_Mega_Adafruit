# Arduino_RED_Mega_Adafruit
This project uses Bill tarpi's code [http://wirebeings.com/Android-RC-CAR.html](here) using an RC car modified.

The car has a DC motor for the 2 back wheels and an SG90 servo for the front wheels.

The project uses an ARDUINO MEGA with the motor shield and an HC-04 (or HC-05) bluetooth module for comunications connected to Serial1 pins on rduino mega.

Signals are sent from the app [Arduino Bluetooth RC Car](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=braulio.calle.bluetoothRCcontroller&hl=it) that you have to install into your smartphone/tablet.
